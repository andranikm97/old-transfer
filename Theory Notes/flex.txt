Parent props:

2) flex-direction: defines the direction of item positioning
  - row | row-reverse | column | column-reverse

3) flex-wrap: allow the items to wrap as needed with this property
  - no-wrap | wrap | wrap-reverse

4*) flex-flow: shorthand for flex-direction + flex-wrap
  - flex-direction | flex-wrap;


5) justify-content: defines the alignment along the main axis
  - flex-start | flex-end | start | end | left | right | center 
  | space-between | space-around | space-evenly;

6) align-items: defines the alignment along the cross axis
  - stretch | flex-start | flex-end | center | baseline | first baseline 
  | last baseline | start | end | self-start | self-end + ... safe | unsafe;

7) align-content: This aligns a flex containerâ€™s lines within when there is extra space in the cross-axis:
  - flex-start | flex-end | center | space-between | space-around 
  | space-evenly | stretch | start | end | baseline | first baseline | last baseline + ... safe | unsafe


Child props:

1) flex-grow: This defines the ability for a flex item to grow if necessary
  - default: 0, other: positive #s
  - if all children have 1 set, then space is distributed evenly among them

2) flex-shrink: defines the ability for a flex item to shrink if necessary.
  - default: 1, other: positive #s

3) flex-basis: defines the default size of an element
  - default: auto, other: length, percentage or rem

4*) flex: shorthand for flex-grow, flex-shrink and flex-basis
  - none | [ <'flex-grow'> <'flex-shrink'>? || <'flex-basis'> ]

5) align-self: overrides the align-items property of the parent for a particular element
  - auto | flex-start | flex-end | center | baseline | stretch
